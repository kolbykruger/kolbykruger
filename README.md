### Hi there, I'm [Kolby!](https://kolbykruger.github.io)

A web designer & developer based in Burlington, Vermont. Websites are one of the most effective ways for me to leave my creative mark on the world. I work with people from all walks of life and in a wide range of industries.

- I’m currently employed at [Place Creative Company](https://github.com/Place-Creative) in Burlington, Vermont.
- I’m currently working with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), and [Prismic](http://prismic.io/).
- I’m currently learning more about [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and the newly released [Nuxt 3](https://nuxtjs.org/).
